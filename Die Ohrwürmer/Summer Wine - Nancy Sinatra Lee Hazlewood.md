Am                               G

   Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring.

Am                            G

   My summer wine is really made from all these things.

Am                            G

   I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled too.

Am                        G

   A song that I had only sang to just a few.

Dm                             Am

   She saw my silver spurs and said let's pass some time.

Dm                       Am

   And I will give to you summer wine.

Dm              Am

Ohhh-oh, summer wine.

Dm                               Am

   Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time.

Am                           G

   My eyes grew heavy and my lips they could not speak.

Am                         G

   I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet.

Dm                          Am

   She reassured me with an unfamiliar line.

Dm                        Am

   And then she gave to me more summer wine.

Dm              Am

Ohhh-oh, summer wine.

Am                            G

   When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes.

Am                               G

   My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size.

Dm                             Am

   She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime.

Dm                        Am

   And left me cravin' for more summer wine.

Dm              Am    Am6

Ohhh-oh, summer wine.
