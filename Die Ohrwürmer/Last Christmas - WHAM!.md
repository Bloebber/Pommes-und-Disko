[Chorus]

G

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

        Em

But the very next day you gave it away

Am

This year to save me from tears

     D

I'll give it to someone special

 

[Chorus]

G

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

        Em

But the very next day you gave it away

This year to save me from tears

[Verse 1]

G

 Once bitten and twice shy

Em                                        [ Am ]

 I keep my distance but you still catch my eye

Am

 Tell me baby do you recognize me?

D

 Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

 

[Verse 2]

G

 "Merry Christmas!" I wrapped it up and sent it

 (whispered)

Em

With a note saying: "I love you!", I meant it

Am

Now I know what a fool I've been

           D

But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

 

[Chorus]

G

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

        Em

But the very next day you gave it away

Am

This year to save me from tears

     D

I'll give it to someone special

 

[Chorus]

G

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

        Em

But the very next day you gave it away

Am

This year to save me from tears

     D

I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 3]

G

 Crowded room, friends with tired eyes

Em

 Hiding from you and your soul of ice

Am

 My God, I thought you were someone to rely on

D

Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

 

[Verse 4]

  G

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

  Em                                    [ Am ]

A man undercover but you tore him apart

                        (To-o-ore   me  apa-art)

Am

    Ooh-hoo

         D

Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

 

[Chorus]

G

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

        Em

But the very next day you gave it away

Am

This year to save me from tears

     D

I'll give it to someone special

 

[Chorus]

G

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

        Em

But the very next day you gave it away

Am

This year to save me from tears

     D

I'll give it to someone special

 

[Verse 5]

  G

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart

  Em

A man undercover but you tore him apart

Am

 Maybe ... next year ...

(spoken)

     D                                              [ G ]

I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone ... special

 

[Fade-out]
